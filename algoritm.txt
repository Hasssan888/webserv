1. Start
2. Read & parse configuration file
3. Create a listening socket for each configured port
4. Set sockets to non-blocking mode
5. Initialize pollfd list with listening sockets
6. Loop forever:
    a. Call poll(fds)
    b. For each fd:
        i. If it's a listening socket → accept new client
            - Add client socket to pollfd list
        ii. If it's a client socket:
            - If readable → read data (recv)
                - Parse HTTP request
                - If complete:
                    - Generate response based on method (GET, POST, DELETE)
                    - Prepare CGI if needed
                    - Set fd to POLLOUT
            - If writable → send response (send)
                - If all sent → close socket or keep-alive
7. On disconnection or error → close fd and remove it
8. Go back to step 6
